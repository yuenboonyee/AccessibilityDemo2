This demo illustrates how to:
- make a form accessible, even with elements that are contained in a UIView subview.
- make a graph accessible using the UIAccessibilityContainer informal protocol.
- Listen to UIAccessibility notifications and query the UIAccessibility framework for the accessibility status.
